# Jpaint

Final project for SE 450 in which a basic, moderately-sized, MS Paint-like application was built using object-oriented design principles. Feature set includes drawing shapes (ellipses, rectangles, triangles) with various colors and fill types, moving shapes, copy/paste, delete, undo/redo, and group/ungroup. Per requirements, the application was to be written in Java using the Java2 SDK 1.8 or higher.
